# $TEER Token



<mark style="color:green;">**1.WHAT IS TEER**</mark>

The TEER Token has a hard cap of 10M and is directed at utility and governance.

A portion is allocated for our early contributor, for the slot auctions to secure parachain slots, the further development of the network and ecosystem and long term the treasury, which will be governed one chain and decentralized by token holders in the future.

This means that every token holder will have the power to drive the future development of the platform and the future of privacy-preserving apps and ecosystems.

Thus, governance — which relies on coin voting — should also be unified. Therefore, a single council will be elected and all acts involving coin voting will be aggregated across all parachains/parathreads.

The value of the TEER token is driven by demand for our technology. As demand continues to grow the value of the token will increase in the long term. By definition, the TEER token has an intrinsic value: users need it to pay for operating in the Integritee network. To ensure that costs are stable and predictable for Integritee users, the usage will be denominated in fiat.

A burning function burns a fraction of each fee paid to the treasury. This implies that the overall TEER token supply is deflationary. In a nutshell: Each time a user pays for Integritee's service with TEER tokens, a fraction of the TEER token transaction is burned.

**Q\&A**

<mark style="color:green;">Do the token holders have the right to participate in the governance of the project? What kind of decisions can they vote on about the project?</mark>

Yes they do! Every token holder will have the power to drive the future development of the platform and the future of privacy-preserving apps and ecosystems.

Thus, governance — which relies on coin voting — should also be unified. Therefore, a single council will be elected and all acts involving coin voting will be aggregated across all parachains/parathreads.

<mark style="color:green;">What is the utility of $TEER token and how are the holders rewarded?</mark>

The value of the TEER token is driven by demand for our technology. As demand continues to grow the value of the token will increase in the long [term. By](http://term.by/) definition, the TEER token has an intrinsic value: users need it to pay for operating in the Integritee network. To ensure that costs are stable and predictable for Integritee users, the usage will be denominated in fiat.

A burning function burns a fraction of each fee paid to the treasury. This implies that the overall TEER token supply is deflationary. In a nutshell: Each time a user pays for Integritee's service with TEER tokens, a fraction of the TEER token transaction is burned.

We have a hard cap of 10m tokens and only a single native token, the TEER, which can freely float among multiple parachains and ecosystems.

A portion is allocated for our early contributor, for the slot auctions to secure parachain slots, the further development of the network and ecosystem and long term the treasury, which will be governed one chain and decentralized by token holders in the future.

<mark style="color:green;">What are the token use-case, distribution?</mark>

The value of the TEER token is driven by demand for Integritee technology. We know demand is high - as we can show by the number of interesting partnerships we are exploring in and out of the blockchain space. As demand continues to grow the value of the token will increase in the long term.

Our intermediary framework also allows for our technology to become accessible to enterprises outside the blockchain space. The TEER token has been designed so that its value will reflect this core competitive advantage, thereby linking the value of an off-chain technology with an on-chain token.

By definition, the TEER token has an intrinsic value: users need it to pay for operating in the Integritee network. To ensure that costs are stable and predictable for Integritee users, the usage will be denominated in fiat.

Integritee will have a single native token, the TEER, which can freely float among multiple parachains.

Thus, governance — which relies on coin voting — should also be unified. Therefore, a single council will be elected and all acts involving coin voting will be aggregated across all parachains/parathreads.

Integritee aims to decentralize the Integritee Network as quickly as possible. During the launch phase, it will still have absolute power over the parachain through a “sudo” account. As soon as stable operation has been demonstrated, control over the parachain will be handed over to an elected Governing Council. The TEER token allows its holders to vote for individuals or entities seeking election to the council.

This means that every token holder will have the power to drive the future development of the platform and the future of privacy-preserving apps and ecosystems.

<mark style="color:green;">Is there any benefit from storing TEER tokens for a long time?</mark>

By definition, the TEER token has an intrinsic value: users need it to pay for operating in the Integritee network. To ensure that costs are stable and predictable for Integritee users, the usage will be denominated in fiat. As demand continues to grow the value of the token will increase in the long term and investors know this. We are also looking to empower retail investors through our IEO, Token Sale and of-course with high token rewards in our para-chain crowd loans!

Integritee will have a single native token, the TEER, which can freely float among multiple parachains.

Thus, governance — which relies on coin voting — should also be unified.
