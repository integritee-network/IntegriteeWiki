# Attesteer

The Attesteer combines the trust of a public ledger & the confidentiality of Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) – hardware where computations run securely, confidentially, and verifiably due to our decentralized attestation service.&#x20;

As secure and isolated environments, TEEs leverage security features provided by CPU vendors and prevent unauthorized access or modification of applications and data while in use, thus increasing and solidifying the security for organizations that manage sensitive data or applications. Integritee uses Intel’s SGX technology to verify the TEE’s authenticity, which is crucial for confidential computing. This authentication process is known as attestation, which users of Intel SGX can register with Intel or with our unique Attesteer service.​

Our attestation service is relevant to any user of TEEs seeking to benefit from public auditability and an effortless, seamlessly integrable service. Besides delivering the same proofs as Intel’s service, the Attesteer additionally verifies that the software running inside TEEs has not been modified.

All the information delivered by the Attesteer is registered on Integritee’s blockchain. In contrast to Intel’s offering – only registered clients can verify the integrity of the TEE and process – our public ledger registration makes the process verifiable to any third party, like institutions that want to prove to their customers that their data is secure and sovereign, or in case of data sharing collaborations between multiple parties.

#### Main advantages

• Data and processes’ integrity is verified and registered on our own public network = transparency & trust​

• Provides superior interoperability as it can be applied to any Intel SGX enclave​

• Highly customizable: Remotely attests at the frequency and duration of your choice​

• Fees for the usage of our network are charged in TEER. Services are offered at a stable USD price as TEER usage fees are automatically adjusted according to the fixed USD price and current TEER/USD exchange rate​
