# SDK – Software Development Kit

Our Sidechain Software Development Kit (SDK) enables developers to build solutions quickly, easily, and optimized for any use case. Developers are able to add privacy features and freely decide which information to keep confidential and which to make public.​

The SDK is relevant to any Substrate (the blockchain framework that underlies Polkadot) developer in need of low latencies, scalability and/or confidentiality. Both existing Substrate-based projects and developers who want to build a new application from scratch can leverage the benefits of our SDK.​

Substrate pallets – pre-built modules of the Substrate framework – can be reused and instantiated inside an Integritee Sidechain with just a few lines of glue code. Developers are able to structure their use case on Substrate, write their own pallets and integrate any of them seamlessly (without modification) into the Sidechain SDK to benefit from low latencies, scalability, and confidentiality. The SDK sidechain is written in the programming language _rust_.​

#### Main advantages

• Unrivalled speed: Up to 1 million transactions per second​

• TEE’s verifiable nature makes SDK trustworthy & transparent

• SDK allows you to choose what suits you best: run it on your hardware or rent it out from us​

• Privacy by design: TEE technology ensures data protection & compliance with privacy regulations​

• SDK is interoperable with other blockchain systems & web2 API​
