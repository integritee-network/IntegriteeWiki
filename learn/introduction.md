## Roadmap <a href="#roadmap" id="roadmap"></a>

Since our initial steps in 2018 – with the release of the Encointer Whitepaper – “Local Community Cryptocurrencies with Universal Basic Income” and the start of the SubstraTEE journey – IntegriTEE has been an important piece of the web3 and blockchain puzzle which is constantly under development and updating. Thus enhancing, democratizing, and expanding the use of this technology to improve speed and trust over data management and transfer.

**2019-2021**

Within the first year we made it to demonstrate private token transactions at our First SubstraTEE Meetup and after granting Substrate Transaction Privacy using Intel SGX and Substrate Rust API client over two different stages. The first part of 2020 was the time for a 3rd Web3 Grant: SubstraTEE extension pack, followed by the development of a Prototype Platform based on SubstraTEE and the First deployed and running use case with Encointer on the Platform which opened up the doors for IntegriTEE to achieve the Polkadot Treasury Grant “SubstraTEE scalability” and move on to the next stage.

We started 2021 by launching the Rococo Testnet Parachain and the conceptualizing and preparation of a Spin-off from the SCS event that would lead to the formal and official constitution of IntegriTEE AG and our first Seed Round Close followed by a new brand and website relaunch, moving from SubstraTEE to IntegriTEE and releasing Tokenomics, as well as the participation in a public slot auction on Kusama, Mainnet & Token launch and the start of community growth. We finalized the year deploying the first practical use-case hosted on the Integritee mainnet: the US dollar exchange rate oracle, TEEracle **(LINK)**, listing TEER on the major exchange ecosystems, and adding the Ambassador Program to our strategies.

**2022**

The current year’s kick-off was marked by the Kusama secure slot achievement and the Sidechain Demo release, second exchange listing, and wrap-up of the strategic plan for an intense and promising 2022, where we’ve already migrated from Solo to Kusama Parachain and [integrated XCM with other projects](https://medium.com/integritee/xcm-integration-of-integritee-and-moonriver-is-completed-xcteer-is-now-live-and-available-on-9a0bde399911).

Three great releases are making out of IntegriTEE what it’s meant to be: Sidechain SDK v 1.0 **(LINK TO ARTICLE)**, Sidechain with Smart Contracts and generic trusted oracle framework **(LINK TO ARTICLE)** and TEERacle **(LINK TO ARTICLE)**.

We were also able to achieve the deployment of our first-end client usable App. Expanding the company’s business development strategy we made it to forge partnerships with international institutions and universities from all over the world. Also, OVH Marketplace was secured with the SecuriTEE Solution release and a 3rd exchange listing has been created.

On decentralization and democratization matters probably the greatest highlight so far this year is the [removal of SUDO and enabling coin voting with TEER](https://medium.com/integritee/integritee-completes-2-key-milestones-towards-decentralization-40df43ab320).

**2022-2023**

Great things are coming ahead for IntegriTEE, its clients, and the community, as SUDO pallet has been recently removed from our parachain. The decision to remove SUDO was the first key vote taken by TEER holders as one of many active ways of democratic participation our framework deploys.

Looking ahead, Sidechain SDK v 1.1 will be released, and Treasury grants to expand the IntegriTEE ecosystem and community will definitely be issued. Our strategy also forecasts the expansion to more countries and the creation of new local communities. Burning and lock drop mechanisms final fee will be ready for implementation, together with the release of the Attesteer framework to scale up remote attestation.

New projects are possible thanks to newly forged partnerships after attending events like Polkadot Decoded 2022 **(LINK TO ARTICLE + CONTENT OF OUR PARTICIPATION)** and the listing of a 4th exchange. Our plan for wrapping up the year is to release Sidechain SDK v 1.2 and Securitee Sidechain as a Service, and establish a multi-environment TEER token. We also want to continue forging partnerships and publish our 5th exchange listing. Integritee plans to secure a Polkadot Parachain slot in order to establish IntegriTEE as the leading Polkadot privacy solution.

As “building and securing bridges” is one of the things that define us, next year we will release a Kusama-Polkadot bridge towards a Hybrid Sidechain and connection to other Ecosystems. The deployment of the first enterprise POCs is also on the menu. We hope that you are ready to unchain the value of your sensitive data. At scale.
