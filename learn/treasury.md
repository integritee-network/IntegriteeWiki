# Treasury

Integritee’s Treasury holds the funds that secure the future development of the Integritee platform, community, and ecosystem development. In order to benefit from Polkadot’s shared security features, Integritee intends to occupy parachain slots on both [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/about/) and [Kusama](https://guide.kusama.network/). Parachain slots are a limited resource. As demand for these slots is likely to exceed the supply, Polkadot has designed a unique auction framework to allocate the parachains to the projects generating the highest value for users.

**TEER is also used to:**

* Improve the platform and protocol operations
* Enhance the network’s security operations
* Support software development
* Grant treasury funds and rewards to our community

Firms intending to use Integritee’s service need to acquire our token (TEER), either on the open market or through an intermediary that accepts fiat payments and pays the on-chain fees on their behalf. A token can only have intrinsic value if it serves to achieve a purpose, such as giving access to a valuable service. This creates a direct relationship between the value of Integritee’s services and the demand for the token. As a result, when the demand for Integritee’s services increases, demand for TEER – and its value – will also increase.

The core competitive advantage of the Integritee platform is our technology, which enables a service that is superior to the competition. The TEER token has been designed so that its value will reflect this core competitive advantage, thereby linking the value of an off-chain technology with an on-chain token.

We build and secure bridges to enable developers and firms unlock the value of their sensitive data. By combining the trust of Polkadot, the scalability of second-layer sidechains, and the confidentiality of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) hardware, Integritee aims to power a new generation of data-driven dApps and services.
