# Glossary

We know it might not be easy to navigate the blockchain – and Polkadot – world at first. We've come up with a glossary that helps everyone grasp some essential concepts regarding our project and the universe it lives in.

### Blockchain

### Bridges

### Crowdloan

Polkadot allows parachains to source tokens for their parachain bids in a decentralised crowdloan.

Anyone who has registered a parachain can create a new crowdloan campaign for a slot by depositing a specified number of tokens. A campaign is configured as a range of slots (i.e. the duration of the [parachain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains) will bid for), a cap, and a duration. The duration can last over several auctions, meaning that the team will not need to restart the campaign just because they do not secure a slot on their first attempt.

### Decentralization

In blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network.

Decentralization ensures that the blockchain is not governed by an individual, group, or even the government. It is distributed in a systematic digital network so that nobody can meddle with the transactions. Other securities are managed by specific individuals that lead to a possibility of human error and bias.

### GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area. The GDPR is an important component of EU privacy law and of human rights law, in particular Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

### Governance

### Integritee

Integritee is a parachain on Kusama, and the most scalable public blockchain solution for securely processing sensitive business or personal data.

### Intel SGX

**Intel Software Guard Extensions** is a set of security-related instruction codes that are built into some Intel central processing units. They allow user-level and operating system code to define private regions of memory, called enclaves, whose contents is inaccessible from the outside.

### Kusama

### Oracle

### OVH

Cloud infrastructures, dedicated hosting, domain names, e-commerce, storage and archiving and virtual servers; OVH is a solution to develop IT projects. OVH offers a wide range of IT services to companies, and to individuals passionate about tech.

### Parachain

### Polkadot

### Relay Chain

### **SDK**

### **Sidechain**

A sidechain is a separate blockchain network that connects to another blockchain – called a parent blockchain or mainnet – via a two-way peg. ****&#x20;

The Polkadot platform offers highly competitive scalability balanced with security and flexibility. However, some use cases require transaction privacy, high transaction throughput, or low latency. Integritee sidechains are ideally suited to processing sensitive data at scale, or for any blockchain use case that requires ultra-fast response times.

### **Substrate**

### **TEER**

The TEER token is the fuel that drives the Integritee platform — a common token across both Kusama and Polkadot parachains. Integritee users will require TEER to pay for Integritee services. Given the growing consumer and regulatory pressure for data services that protect user privacy, technologies like Integritee are rapidly becoming essential for firms. The value of TEER is directly linked to our core competitive advantage as well as other features of the economic system, such as the burn mechanism and lockdrop, are designed to drive long-term growth in TEER value.   &#x20;

### **Teeracle**

### **Trusted Execution Environment**

A **** secure area of a main processor. It guarantees code and data loaded inside to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity, Data integrity — prevents unauthorized entities from altering data when any entity outside the TEE processes data, Code integrity — the code in the TEE cannot be replaced or modified by unauthorized entities. This is done by implementing unique, immutable, and confidential architectural security such as Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) which offers hardware-based memory encryption that isolates specific application code and data in memory.

### XCM Integration



### Wallet

A wallet address is **a string of letters and numbers from which cryptocurrencies or NFTs can be sent to and from**. A wallet address is also known as a Public Key and can be shared with different contacts like an email address.

### Web3

Web3 (also known as Web 3.0 and sometimes stylized as web3) is **an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web based on blockchain technology**, which incorporates concepts such as decentralization and token-based economics.

Web3 hosts decentralized apps that run on blockchain technology. Web3 advocates emphasize user privacy and ownership of data.
