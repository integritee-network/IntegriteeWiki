# Integritee Network

Integritee is a parachain of the Kusama Relay chain, with all of its network security and consensus provided by Kusama's Validator set. As a [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io)-based chain, most of Integritee's integration points are the same as Kusama and Polkadot. As a parachain specifically though, the key differences will be outlined in this document.
